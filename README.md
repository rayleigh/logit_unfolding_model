This repo contains code needed to run the logit unfolding model and compute the WAIC for the results. The code is divided into two folders: one for the Stan code and one using a Gibbs sampler. The folder containing the Gibbs sampler also has code to generate the mixture of normal distributions to approximate the Gumbel distribution. For those who want a mixture of normal distributions, a .Rdata file is included.
